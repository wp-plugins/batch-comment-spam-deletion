== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the number of comments deleted per batch? =

Yes, there are two ways to do it.

1. You can modify the number via a filter, like this:

`
<?php
function pw_bcsd_per_batch( $per_batch ) {
	
	$per_batch = 50;

	return $per_batch;
}
add_filter( 'pw_bcpd_comments_per_batch', 'pw_bcsd_per_batch' );
`

2. You can modify it by adding a constant to your `wp-config.php` file:

`define( 'PW_BCPD_PER_BATCH', 50 );`
